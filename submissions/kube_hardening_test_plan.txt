Write at least 200 words describing a Kubernetes-specific test plan based on what you learned from the course:

- To answer about how to test the changes and how to make sure that they don't negatively affect the cluster:
    1. we use rancher benchmark assement pdf after getting the findings from kube-bench we need to weight the risk what could really hurt the cluster the most and work on it as a priority.
    2. checking with other team members and testing the changes in non-production environment. 
    3. we can use a canary testing to see how it is gonna work under heavy traffic in a staging cluster to evaluate if the hardened version is acceptable or not.
    4. finally we deploy the changes to production again with close monitoring for regressions to ensure the stability of the cluster.
